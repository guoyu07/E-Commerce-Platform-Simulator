### Description of the project:
This is a project which is used to simulate a large scale E-Commerce. Also, I am going to use Java to implement this project based on based on TPCW benchmark and classical multi-tier architecture. The platform has following properties: Client Emulator, Distributed Database System, back-end monitor system, read in and write out controlling system. More details will be filled in later on! 

Working copy of Java TPC-W implementation used at U. Minho. This version was put together in http://gorda.di.uminho.pt and http://red.lsd.di.uminho.pt projects by R. Vila√ßa, M. Araujo, and others. The master branch includes only minor fixes. See branch uminho for an updated build system.
